<h2>Create project based on ng-cli tool</h2>
<p>Hi everybode! Today I started series of articles to create blog based on angular 5, bootstrap and spring reactive backend.</p>
<h3>Install Angular CLI and create new project</h3>
<p>Let's install CLI for Angular applications </p>
<p>angular npm install -g @angular/cli</p>

Then we create new angular project via angular@clie
<p>ng new blog-front-app --styles==scss</p>


<p>Ng-Bootstrap contains a set of native Angular directives based on Bootstrap’s markup and CSS. As a result no dependency on jQuery or Bootstrap’s JavaScript is required. Ng-Bootstrap is based on Bootstrap 4 and can be added to your Angular project is the following way.</p>
npm install bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.6

npm install --save @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap

<p>Add to .angular-cli.json</p>
"scripts": [
"../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
"../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"
],

<p>Also you can find that package.json include npm actions that's quite nice in use.</p>

"scripts": {
  "ng": "ng",
  "start": "ng serve",
  "build": "ng build --prod",
  "test": "ng test",
  "lint": "ng lint",
  "e2e": "ng e2e"
},

<p>Add to app.module.ts</p>
import {NgbModule} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';

<p>Copy fonts to assets directory</p>

<p>Please also check in .angular-cli.json</p>

"styles": [
"styles.scss"
],

<p>Add font-face rule to style.scss</p>
